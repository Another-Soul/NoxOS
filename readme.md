# NoxOS

NoxOS is a game about OS evolution. There are a total of 31 versions of this OS (not the game itself), with 3 being developed and 28 undeveloped. It is heavily inspired by Progressbar95, a game by icoeye. There are currently 7 versions (5 releases and 2 prereleases). The current production release is **v0.2.2** (y2024-m05-d26), and the actual latest version is **v0.3-alpha3** (y-2024-m06-d04). Make sure to check out the wiki page if you want to know more about the in-game content!
